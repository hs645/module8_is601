#10 4.972 INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of httpcore to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
#10 4.974 ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 13) and h11>=0.16.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
#10 4.974 
#10 4.974 The conflict is caused by:
#10 4.974     The user requested h11>=0.16.0
#10 4.974     httpcore 1.0.6 depends on h11<0.15 and >=0.13

#10 4.974     h11
#10 4.974 
#10 4.974 To fix this you could try to:
#10 4.974 1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
#10 4.974 2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
