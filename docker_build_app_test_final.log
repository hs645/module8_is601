#10 3.562 ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 10) and starlette>=0.49.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
#10 3.562 
#10 3.562 The conflict is caused by:
#10 3.562     The user requested starlette>=0.49.1
#10 3.562     fastapi 0.115.4 depends on starlette<0.42.0 and >=0.40.0

#10 3.562     starlette
#10 3.562 
#10 3.562 To fix this you could try to:
#10 3.562 1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
#10 3.562 2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
